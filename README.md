1. Click any of the pre-mentioned buttons on the page and it will append a limit of 10 musician gifs to the page.

2. If you want to create a search for another specific artist of your choosing, you can search for the artist by looking them up in the musician search engine button. 

3. Once you have the gifs loaded onto the page, you can make the image play and stop by clicking on the individual images. 

4. Repeat steps 1-3.

# App Development..

1. After typing up the HTML which includes a search div and a button div, we continue by typying up the javascript.

2. I started with a topics variable that contains an array of strings that show our specified gif categories. 

3. Starting out with "document.ready" allows the page to run the script after the page officially load. 

4. We create an onclick function that retrieves data from the API entered into the queryURL section of the code.
